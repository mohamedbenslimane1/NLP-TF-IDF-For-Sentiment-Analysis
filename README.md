NLP TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is a weighting method often used in information retrieval and particularly in text mining. 
This statistical measure helps assess the importance of a term contained in a document relative to a collection or corpus. The weight increases proportionally with the number of occurrences 
of the word in the document. It also varies depending on the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variants of the original formula are often used in search engines to evaluate
the relevance of a document based on the user's search criteria.

In the TF-IDF scheme, it aims to give more weight to less frequent terms, considered more discriminative. 
We apply this scheme to a dataset : Sentiment Analysis for Financial News. We implement different text encodings classification models, a naive Bayesian model and a neural network.
